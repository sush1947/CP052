Requirement Analysis for the Code:

1. *Authentication System:*
   - Users should be able to log in with a username and password.
   - There are two types of users: administrators and customers.
   - The system should support up to 10 users.

2. *User Roles:*
   - Administrators can perform administrative tasks.
   - Customers can perform customer-specific tasks.

3. *Element Management:*
   - Administrators can add elements to a list.
   - Elements have integer values.
   - The list can hold up to 100 elements.
   - Elements can be displayed.

4. *Search Functionality for Customers:*
   - Customers can perform two types of searches: linear and binary.
   - Linear search: Customers can search for an element in the list using linear search and get the index if found.
   - Binary search: Customers can search for an element in the list using binary search and get the index if found.
5. *Menus:*
   - The system provides separate menus for administrators and customers.
   - Menus should be interactive, allowing users to choose options.
   - Administrators have options to add elements and display elements.
   - Customers have options for searching and logging out.

6. *Error Handling:*
   - The system should handle invalid inputs gracefully, providing appropriate error messages.
   - For example, it should handle incorrect login credentials, invalid menu choices, and element list full scenarios.

7. *Looping and Continuity:*
   - The system should run in an infinite loop, allowing users to perform multiple actions without exiting.
   - Users can log out to exit their respective menus.

8. *Feedback and Confirmation:*
   - The system should provide feedback to users for successful operations, such as adding an element or finding an element.
   - It should confirm logout actions.

9. *Code Modularity:*
   - The code should be modular, with separate functions for different functionalities (e.g., login, menu handling, search algorithms).

10. *Security:*
    - User passwords should be stored securely.
    - The system should ensure that only administrators can perform administrative tasks.

11. *Limitations:*
 - The system has fixed limits, such as the maximum number of users and the maximum number of elements in the list.

12. *Initialization:*
    - User accounts and the element list should be initialized with default values.

13. *User Experience:*
    - The system should provide a user-friendly interface with clear prompts and instructions.

14. *Robustness:*
    - The code should be robust and handle potential issues, such as buffer overflows in input.
15. *Maintainability:*
    - The code should be well-documented and organized to facilitate future maintenance and updates.

16. *Scalability:*
    - The system should be designed to accommodate potential future enhancements or changes in requirements.

17. *Efficiency:*
    - The search algorithms (linear and binary) should be efficient, especially for large lists.

18. *Testing:*
    - The system should be thoroughly tested to ensure it meets the specified requirements and functions correctly.

19. *Security and Data Protection:*
    - The system should ensure the security and privacy of user data and prevent unauthorized access.

20. *User Account Management:*
    - There should be provisions for adding and managing user accounts, but these features are not included in the current code.
