Design Architecture:

The design architecture of the provided code can be summarized as follows:

1. Front-End Design:
   - The front-end of the code is text-based and interacts with users through the command line.
   - It relies on simple input/output operations to get user input and display information.
   - The user interface design is minimalistic, consisting of text-based menus and prompts.

2. Back-End Design:
   - The back-end of the code handles the core functionality of user authentication, menu navigation, and element manipulation.
   - User authentication is managed through a login function that checks user credentials against predefined data.
   - The code differentiates between administrators and customers, directing them to their respective menus.
   - For administrators, there's an admin menu allowing them to add elements to the list and display its contents.
   - For customers, there's a customer menu offering linear and binary search functionalities on the list of elements.

3. Database Design:
   - The code doesn't use a traditional database; instead, it stores user and element data in memory.
   - User information is stored in an array of user structures (`User`).
   - Element data is managed through an `ElementList` structure that includes an array and a size variable.

File Handling Concepts:

The provided code primarily focuses on in-memory data management rather than file handling. However, here's a brief overview of file handling concepts:

1. File Input/Output (I/O):
   - In C, you can use functions like `fopen`, `fclose`, `fread`, `fwrite`, `fprintf`, and `fscanf` to read from and write to files.
   - These functions allow you to open files, read data from them, write data to them, and close them when done.

2. File Streams:
   - In C, files are treated as streams of data. You can create streams for reading (`FILE *fp = fopen("file.txt", "r")`) or writing (`FILE *fp = fopen("output.txt", "w")`) data.
   - Streams provide a buffered way to work with files efficiently.

3. Error Handling:
   - File handling functions often return NULL or specific error codes when there's an issue with file operations.
   - Proper error handling should be implemented to check for errors during file operations.

4. Modes:
   - When opening a file, you specify a mode (`"r"`, `"w"`, `"a"`, `"rb"`, `"wb"`, etc.) to define whether you're reading or writing and whether you're working with binary or text data.

5. File Pointers:
   - File pointers (`FILE *`) are used to keep track of the current position in a file when reading or writing.
   - They are moved automatically when reading or writing data.

In the context of the provided code, file handling concepts are not directly applied, as the code focuses on in-memory data management. However, if you intend to extend this code to include file-based data storage, you would incorporate these file handling concepts to read and write data to external files.
