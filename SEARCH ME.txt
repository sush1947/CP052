Search Me :
Create application to searching the given element with the help of searching algorithms
(binary search, linear search etc..)
Take the inputs from the user like in which algorithm they want to find the element and
take the searched element .
admin : can able to do the basic CRUD operations
customer : able to do give the inputs and by using this application they need to get
exact answer
for both admin and customer we need login page



Main Function:
- The main function is the entry point of the program.
- It initializes two main data structures: `User` and `ElementList`.
- It also initializes a variable `loggedInUser` to keep track of the currently logged-in user.

User Structure:
- Defines a structure called `User` to store information about users.
- Each user has a username (up to 20 characters), a password (up to 20 characters), and an isAdmin flag (1 for admin, 0 for customer).

ElementList Structure:
- Defines a structure called `ElementList` to store a list of integers.
- It has an array `data` to hold the integers and a variable `size` to keep track of the number of elements in the list.

Login Function:
- Takes user input for a username and password.
- Compares the input credentials with pre-defined user data.
- If a match is found, it sets the `loggedInUser` variable to the index of the logged-in user and returns that index. Otherwise, it returns -1 for a failed login.

Admin Menu Function (adminMenu):
- Provides a menu for administrators.
- Options include adding elements to the `ElementList` and displaying its contents.
- Continues running until the administrator chooses to log out.

Customer Menu Function (customerMenu):
- Provides a menu for customers.
- Options include performing linear or binary searches on the `ElementList` for specific elements.
- Continues running until the customer chooses to log out.

Element Manipulation Functions:
- `addElement`: Adds an element to the `ElementList` if there is space.
- `displayElements`: Displays the elements stored in the `ElementList`.
- `linearSearch`: Searches for an element in the `ElementList` using a linear search algorithm.
- `binarySearch`: Searches for an element in the `ElementList` using a binary search algorithm.

Program Flow:
- The program begins by initializing users, the element list, and the `loggedInUser` variable.
- It enters a loop that continues until the user chooses to log out.
- Inside the loop, it checks whether the user is an admin or a customer and displays the respective menu.
- The user can perform various actions based on their role, and the program responds accordingly.
- The loop continues until the user chooses to log out.

Overall, this code demonstrates a basic user authentication system, menu-driven interface, and simple data manipulation functions in C. It allows admins to manage elements in a list and customers to search for elements within that list.
